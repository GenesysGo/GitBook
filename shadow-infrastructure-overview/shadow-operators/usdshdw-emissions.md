# $SHDW Emissions

Shadow Operators receive emissions of $SHDW every Solana epoch. There are roughly 121 epochs per year on the Solana Mainnet. The Shadow Epoch schedule exactly mirrors the Solana Validator epoch schedule.

Approximately 50 $SHDW is paid out per epoch to each Shadow Operator depending on the performance of their machine and its overall stability in serving requests.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
$SHDW payments are not guaranteed. Being a Shadow Operator is no different than running a Solana Validator in terms of needing to contribute to the network.&#x20;

Solana Validators who cannot attract stake and are consistently offline will see themselves earning less and less rewards. Shadow Operators whose machines are not consistently online or are serving requests poorly will similarly earn less and less rewards.
