# Becoming a Shadow Operator

## Steps to becoming a Shadow Operator:

1. You'll need a server! Right now, only machines which meet the minimum required specs for running a Solana server are able to apply. [https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs)
   * The Solana server program has you covered
   * [https://solana.foundation/server-program](https://solana.foundation/server-program)
   * Follow the instructions to gain access to a high powered server curated by Solana themselves!
   * Applicants must apply through the processes outlined in this site and are subject to KYC checks. This is a Solana requirement.
2. Once you have a server up and running you will need to configure it.
   * [https://github.com/Shadowy-Super-Coder-DAO](https://github.com/Shadowy-Super-Coder-DAO) - You may follow the instructions we've written out here or check out the Solana docs [https://docs.solana.com/](https://docs.solana.com)
3. Follow the instructions to register your node - [https://portal.genesysgo.net/#](https://portal.genesysgo.net)
   * Upon registering your node you will be automatically connected to the upstream and your server will be serving Solana Mainnet RPC traffic!
