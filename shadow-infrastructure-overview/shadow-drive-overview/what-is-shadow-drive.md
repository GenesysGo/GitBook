# What is Shadow Drive?

Shadow Drive combines open source software-defined object storage, integrates it with the Solana blockchain’s Proof of History consensus mechanism, and then decentralizes it. This allows us to achieve extremely fast I/O speeds, massive scalability, and data integrity. At the same time, we retain the benefits of the trustlessness, enhanced security, full transparency, and decentralization that blockchain technology brings to the table.

Ultimately, Shadow Drive’s final iteration will be a permissionless, trustless, decentralized distributed storage network that exists in perpetuity without needing to rely on the direct efforts of a centralized team to grow and expand. It will take time, as the path for open sourcing hardware infrastructure is different than software, but Shadow Drive’s final form will be one in which the community drives enhancements, the direction, and future of Shadow Drive.
