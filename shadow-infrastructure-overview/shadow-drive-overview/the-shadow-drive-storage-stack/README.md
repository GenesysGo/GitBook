# The Shadow Drive Storage Stack

The Shadow Drive Stack is broken into two parts: the underlay and the overlay. The following serves as a very basic primer to help one envision Shadow Drive's architecture and is written with the non-technical user in mind.

Certain terms, such as "Underlay" and "Overlay", are far more nuanced than the description in these documents and we would very much encourage anyone with the desire to learn more to use these definitions as their jumping off point into learning more!

For the highly technical, all of our live code is open source and available on our Github to deep dive at your leisure.
