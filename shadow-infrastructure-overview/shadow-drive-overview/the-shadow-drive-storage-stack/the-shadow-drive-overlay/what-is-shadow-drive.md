# What is Shadow Drive?

Shadow Drive takes open source software-defined object storage and integrates it with Solana’s Proof of History consensus mechanism, and then decentralizes it. This allows it to achieve extremely fast I/O speeds, massive scalability, and data integrity. At the same time it retains the benefits of the trustlessness, enhanced security, full transparency, and decentralization that blockchain technology brings to the table.

Ultimately, Shadow Drive’s final iteration will be a permissionless, trustless, decentralized distributed storage network that exists in perpetuity without needing to rely on the direct efforts of a centralized team to grow and expand. It will take time, as the path for open sourcing hardware infrastructure is different from that for software, but Shadow Drive’s final form will be one in which the community drives the direction, enhancements, and future of Shadow Drive.
