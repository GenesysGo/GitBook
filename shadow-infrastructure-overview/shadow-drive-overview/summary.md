# Summary

The Shadow Drive is a new approach to on-chain storage and is built specifically for the Solana blockchain, while retaining the ability to become a polychain service in the future. Other web3 storage providers have attempted to integrate with Solana in the past and have had only marginal success. Shadow Drive solves this by integrating directly with the Proof of History consensus mechanism, passing on-chain events for consensus approval by the Solana validator network which prove the continued existence and integrity of the stored data.

The idea for Shadow Drive was founded on the premise that the Solana network is largely misunderstood in terms of what it was built to achieve. By understanding what it truly means to be the worldâ€™s most performant **state machine** you realize that Solana can be used to reach consensus and maintain state on nearly anything.
