Submit a PR or, if you need immediate help join our discord (discord.gg/genesysgo) and check out the #shdw-drive-support channel! Though, be warned, if you're popping in to submit a bug report then we'll likely thank you very much for your help and then direct you to the github to submit the pug so that way we can properly document everything on our end!

There are A LOT of moving parts when you build a storage network that is designed to interface with the Solana Mainnet chain and so we want to make sure our processes for investigating and solving bugs are well maintained.

Thank you for your help!
